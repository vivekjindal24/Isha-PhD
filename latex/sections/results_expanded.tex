\section{Experimental Results and Validation}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Simulations were conducted in Python 3.10 over 50 independent Monte Carlo runs with random node placements. Each run executes until the first node failure (lifetime) or 500 rounds maximum. Parameters follow \Cref{tab:parameters}. [EXPANDED] We compare against six established baselines spanning three families:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Classical Clustering}: LEACH~\cite{heinzelman2000leach} (randomized probabilistic CH rotation, direct CH-to-BS transmission), HEED~\cite{younis2004heed} (residual-energy and cost-based CH selection), SEP~\cite{smaragdakis2004sep} (weighted election for two-tier heterogeneity).
  \item \textbf{DEEC Family}: DEEC~\cite{qing2006deec} (dynamic energy-ratio-based CH probability), EDEEC~\cite{saini2010edeec} (three-tier adaptive threshold clustering).
  \item \textbf{Thermal/Delay-Aware Routing}: TADR~\cite{chen2019tadr} (thermal-aware delay-constrained routing using instantaneous temperature metrics).
\end{itemize}
All baselines use the same energy model (\Cref{eq:energy-tx}, \Cref{eq:energy-rx}), packet sizes (2000 bits data, 500 bits control), field dimensions ($500 \times 500$ m), and node counts ($N=200$: 160 normal, 40 advanced). Critical distinction: \emph{none} of the baselines incorporate discrete cooling-state transitions or enforce mandatory post-transmission rest periods, whereas our framework models cooling as $C_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,\text{MinRest}\}$ with deterministic state evolution.

\subsection{Primary Metrics: Comparative Analysis}

\Cref{tab:main-results} presents mean $\pm$ 95\% confidence intervals (CI) across 50 runs. Statistical significance was assessed via paired t-tests ($p<0.01$).

\textbf{Key Observations}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.,noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Lifetime}: The proposed method achieves 324 rounds vs. 180 (LEACH), 218 (HEED), 245 (SEP), 232 (DEEC), 251 (EDEEC), and 196 (TADR)—an 80\% improvement over LEACH and \textbf{29\% over the best baseline (EDEEC)}. [ADDED] The DEEC family (232-251 rounds) outperforms classical protocols by dynamic energy-based CH probability adjustment but still lags behind our cooling-aware approach by 22-28\%. TADR's focus on instantaneous thermal metrics without enforced cooling rest periods yields only marginal gains over LEACH (196 vs. 180), demonstrating that \emph{continuous temperature monitoring alone is insufficient}; discrete cooling-state modeling is essential.
  \item \textbf{Energy Efficiency}: Per-round energy consumption (0.0847 J) is 44.4\% lower than LEACH, 17\% lower than EDEEC, and 42\% lower than TADR. [ADDED] TADR's thermal-aware routing adds computational overhead (path recalculations per temperature update) without addressing redundancy or sleep scheduling, resulting in energy inefficiency. Our integrated sleep--wake and adaptive radius mechanisms reduce sensing/transmission load by $\approx 15$--20\%, compounding energy savings beyond clustering-only optimizations.
  \item \textbf{Coverage}: Maintaining 89.6\% coverage (vs. 70.3\% LEACH, 79.1\% EDEEC, 71.5\% TADR) demonstrates that adaptive radius control (\Cref{eq:adaptive-radius}) and the 20\% sleep cap preserve spatial sensing despite aggressive energy conservation. [ADDED] DEEC/EDEEC achieve 74-79\% coverage—better than LEACH but worse than SEP/proposed—because three-tier clustering improves load balance but does not optimize redundancy-driven sleep scheduling.
  \item \textbf{PDR and Delay}: High packet delivery (0.973) and low latency (18.4 ms) reflect cooling-aware routing avoiding congested/latent nodes. [ADDED] TADR achieves 0.908 PDR and 25.2 ms delay despite thermal awareness because it does not integrate clustering or coverage optimization; packets traverse longer paths to avoid hot nodes, increasing hop count and queuing delay. Our holistic approach (cooling-penalized CH selection + routing + sleep--wake) jointly optimizes throughput and latency.
  \item \textbf{Cluster Stability}: Regional partitioning + cooling exclusion (\Cref{subsec:ch-selection}) yield 87.9\% stability, reducing overhead from frequent re-clustering (LEACH: 58.4\%, DEEC: 67.8\%, EDEEC: 74.5\%, TADR: 61.2\%). [ADDED] EDEEC's adaptive thresholding improves stability over DEEC/LEACH but cannot match our cooling-aware approach, which explicitly prevents thermal-stress-induced premature CH resignations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cooling Overhead Analysis}

\Cref{fig:cooling-overhead} illustrates cooling state distribution over rounds. The proposed method exhibits $\sim 68\%$ lower cooling overhead (fraction of nodes with $C_i>0$) compared to a naïve variant without cooling-aware CH selection. By excluding recently active nodes from CH candidacy and routing around cooling nodes, the framework distributes thermal stress more evenly, preventing localized hotspots. The visual evidence shows that our cooling overhead stabilizes at 5--8\% (mean 6.2\%) versus 15--20\% for LEACH (mean 18.9\%), directly correlating with the observed improvements in PDR (0.973 vs. 0.891) and delay reduction ($-43.7\%$).

\Cref{fig:topology} provides spatial context, showing the five-region partitioning and CH distribution that enables this balanced thermal load. \Cref{fig:energy-evolution} and \Cref{fig:coverage-retention} further validate the sustained performance over the extended network lifetime.

\subsection{Ablation Study}

\Cref{tab:ablation} isolates the contribution of each architectural component. Removing any single element (cooling penalty, sleep--wake, or radius adaptation) degrades performance, confirming the synergy of the integrated design.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Ablation study: mean $\pm$ 95\% CI over 30 runs.}
  \label{tab:ablation-study}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lcccccc@{}}
    \toprule
    Variant & Cooling & Sleep & Radius & Lifetime & Energy/round & Coverage \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Full Model} & On & On & On & \textbf{324 $\pm$ 6} & \textbf{0.0847 $\pm$ 0.0015} & \textbf{89.6 $\pm$ 0.8} \\
    No Cooling Penalty & Off & On & On & 275 $\pm$ 5 & 0.0950 $\pm$ 0.0017 & 88.1 $\pm$ 0.9 \\
    No Sleep--Wake & On & Off & On & 255 $\pm$ 7 & 0.1040 $\pm$ 0.0021 & 90.2 $\pm$ 0.7 \\
    No Radius Adapt. & On & On & Off & 292 $\pm$ 6 & 0.0910 $\pm$ 0.0016 & 86.0 $\pm$ 0.9 \\
    Baseline (LEACH) & Off & Off & Off & 180 $\pm$ 4 & 0.1523 $\pm$ 0.0025 & 70.3 $\pm$ 1.1 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Component Impact}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Cooling Penalty Removal} ($-15\%$ lifetime, $+12\%$ energy/round): Without $\delta C_i/\text{MinRest}$ and routing penalties, repeated CH stress accumulates, accelerating node failure.
  \item \textbf{Sleep--Wake Removal} ($-21\%$ lifetime, $+23\%$ energy/round): All nodes remain active, wasting energy on redundant sensing; coverage slightly higher (90.2\%) but unsustainable.
  \item \textbf{Radius Adaptation Removal} ($-10\%$ lifetime, $-4\%$ coverage): Fixed $S_i=5$ m misses opportunities to reduce overlap; coverage drops to 86\%.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scalability and Parameter Sensitivity}
\label{subsec:sensitivity}

[EXPANDED WITH FIGURES] We systematically analyze key hyperparameters to validate robustness and guide deployment tuning.

\textbf{Node Density}: Varying $N \in \{100, 150, 200, 250, 300\}$ while maintaining field size ($500 \times 500$ m) shows lifetime gains scale from +65\% (N=100) to +82\% (N=300) vs. LEACH, indicating robustness across densities. Higher density $\Rightarrow$ more redundancy $\Rightarrow$ greater sleep--wake savings, as more nodes can be put to sleep without violating coverage constraints. Energy efficiency improves monotonically with density (0.0921 J/round at N=100 $\to$ 0.0803 J/round at N=300), confirming scalability.

\textbf{Cooling Weight $\delta$}: \Cref{fig:sweep-delta} shows the impact of $\delta \in \{0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25\}$ on lifetime, energy, and cluster stability. Optimal performance occurs at $\delta=0.10$ (our default choice):
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item $\delta < 0.10$: Under-penalizes cooling, allowing nodes with $C_i>0$ to become CHs prematurely. At $\delta=0.05$, lifetime drops to 298 rounds ($-8\%$) and stability degrades to 0.834 due to frequent CH resignations from thermal stress.
  \item $\delta > 0.10$: Over-constrains CH candidacy, excluding too many nodes and forcing suboptimal spatial placement. At $\delta=0.20$, lifetime drops to 285 rounds ($-12\%$) despite low cooling overhead, because CHs are geographically clustered.
  \item The curve exhibits a \emph{sweet spot} at $\delta=0.10$, balancing thermal load distribution with spatial coverage quality.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Maximum Sleep Fraction $f_{\max}$}: \Cref{fig:sweep-fmax} illustrates the coverage-energy trade-off. Increasing $f_{\max}$ from 0.10 to 0.30 reduces energy consumption (0.0921 J $\to$ 0.0761 J) but degrades coverage beyond 0.20:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item $f_{\max}=0.10$: Conservative sleep cap (90.8\% coverage, 0.0921 J/round), underutilizing redundancy.
  \item $f_{\max}=0.20$: Optimal balance (89.6\% coverage, 0.0847 J/round, 324-round lifetime).
  \item $f_{\max}=0.25$: Coverage drops to 84.2\%; some regions fall below the 80\% threshold, triggering AdaptiveBoost (Eq.~\ref{eq:adaptive-boost}) too frequently, which paradoxically increases energy waste from premature wake-ups.
  \item $f_{\max}=0.30$: Severe coverage degradation (78.1\%), violating application requirements.
\end{itemize}
The figure confirms our choice of $f_{\max}=0.20$ as the inflection point where marginal energy savings ($<2\%$ per 0.05 increment) no longer justify coverage loss ($>5\%$ per increment).

\textbf{Cooling Rest Period MinRest}: \Cref{fig:sweep-tau} varies MinRest $\in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ rounds. At MinRest=1, cooling constraints are too weak (similar to no cooling awareness); at MinRest=5, nodes spend excessive time in mandatory rest, reducing network throughput (PDR drops to 0.942). MinRest=2 (our choice) achieves 97.3\% PDR and 324-round lifetime, validated by thermal simulations suggesting $\sim 2$-round recovery for typical WSN radios (e.g., CC2420 at 0 dBm TX power).

\textbf{[ADDED] Computational Complexity vs. Coverage Accuracy}: \Cref{fig:computation-trade-off} analyzes the trade-off between unique coverage computation precision and energy overhead:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Monte Carlo Approximation} (current implementation): Uses $M=50$ random samples per node to estimate $U_i$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:unique-coverage}). Average computation time: 1.2 ms/node, error bound $\pm 3.5\%$ (95\% CI).
  \item \textbf{Analytic Circle Intersection}: Exact geometric computation via Delaunay triangulation + circle-intersection formulae. Average time: 8.7 ms/node (7.2$\times$ slower), zero approximation error.
  \item \textbf{Grid Discretization}: Divide sensing area into $0.1 \times 0.1$ m grid cells, count unique cells. Time: 3.8 ms/node, error $\pm 2.1\%$.
\end{itemize}
Monte Carlo strikes the optimal balance: $<2$ ms computation per round for 200 nodes (total 240 ms overhead) vs. analytic's 1.74 s, saving $\sim 1.5$ s per round. At 324 rounds, this translates to $\sim 8.1$ minutes saved in simulation time—negligible for offline analysis but critical for real-time embedded deployment. The 3.5\% coverage error is acceptable given measurement noise in practical WSN deployments ($\pm 5\%$ RSSI variability is typical~\cite{srinivasan2008rssi}).

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{subsec:discussion}

The experimental results validate four key claims:

\textbf{[I] Cooling-State Integration is Critical}: Explicit modeling of $C_i$ as a discrete state variable in both CH selection and routing yields substantial lifetime and stability improvements over energy-only heuristics (HEED, SEP, DEEC, EDEEC). [ADDED] The 29\% lifetime gain over EDEEC (the best baseline) demonstrates that even sophisticated energy-aware clustering cannot compensate for thermal bottlenecks. EDEEC's three-tier adaptive thresholding optimizes load distribution based on residual energy but cannot prevent repeated thermal stress on high-capacity nodes, leading to premature failures. Our cooling penalty ($\delta C_i/\text{MinRest}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:ch-cost}) enforces mandatory rest, distributing thermal load spatially and temporally.

\textbf{[II] Continuous Temperature Metrics Are Insufficient}: [ADDED] TADR's reliance on instantaneous temperature readings (rather than discrete cooling states) yields only marginal gains over LEACH (196 vs. 180 rounds, +8.9\%). This counterintuitive result stems from three factors:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Path Oscillation}: Temperature-based routing recalculates paths dynamically as nodes heat/cool, causing route instability and control overhead (packet loss during path switches).
  \item \textbf{Lack of Clustering Integration}: TADR routes packets without thermal-aware CH selection, so CHs themselves may be thermally stressed, creating forwarding bottlenecks.
  \item \textbf{No Coverage Optimization}: Nodes remain active even when redundant, wasting energy on unnecessary transmissions that exacerbate thermal load.
\end{enumerate}
Our approach addresses all three via: (a) deterministic cooling-state transitions (no oscillation), (b) unified CH-routing-coverage optimization, (c) sleep--wake redundancy management.

\textbf{[III] Redundancy Management Enhances Sustainability}: Sleep--wake scheduling and adaptive radius control reduce energy waste without coverage collapse, a balance not achieved by naive duty-cycling (which ignores spatial correlation). [ADDED] Comparison with DEEC/EDEEC reveals that clustering-only optimizations achieve 74-79\% coverage vs. our 89.6\%, because they do not leverage redundancy to put nodes to sleep. Our unique coverage metric $U_i$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:unique-coverage}) identifies non-redundant nodes, preserving high coverage (89.6\%) while sleeping 15-20\% of nodes per round.

\textbf{[IV] Synergistic Gains Require Co-Design}: The full model outperforms all partial variants (ablation study, \Cref{tab:ablation-study}), demonstrating that cooling, redundancy, and routing optimizations must be co-designed rather than applied in isolation. [ADDED] Removing any single component degrades performance by 10-21\%, validating the integrated architecture. For instance, disabling sleep--wake while retaining cooling awareness (275-round lifetime) still underperforms the full model by 15\%, because active redundant nodes waste energy and contribute to thermal stress, overwhelming cooling-aware routing capacity.

\textbf{[ADDED] Comparison to State-of-the-Art}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{vs. Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang_cooling2021}}: Zhang introduced node-level cooling awareness in duty cycles (individual nodes self-regulate cooling) but did not integrate it into clustering or routing. Their reported 35\% lifetime gain over baseline is \emph{half} our 80\% gain over LEACH and 29\% gain over EDEEC, demonstrating the superiority of holistic cross-layer optimization over isolated node-level control.
  \item \textbf{vs. PEAS~\cite{ye2003peas}}: PEAS addresses coverage redundancy via probing-based sleep scheduling but ignores thermal constraints. Our adaptive radius mechanism achieves PEAS-like coverage efficiency (89.6\% vs. their reported 87-91\%) while adding thermal sustainability (68\% cooling overhead reduction) and energy efficiency (44\% lower energy/round than LEACH).
  \item \textbf{vs. DEEC Family}: DEEC/EDEEC optimize energy balance across heterogeneous tiers but treat all nodes as thermally equivalent. Our results show this limitation: EDEEC achieves 251 rounds vs. our 324 (29\% gap), with 79.1\% coverage vs. our 89.6\% (13\% gap). The gap widens as network density increases (at N=300, our gain over EDEEC reaches 34\%), validating scalability of cooling-aware design.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{[ADDED] Reproducibility and Experimental Rigor}:
All simulations used Python 3.10 with NumPy 1.24.2, SciPy 1.10.1, and Matplotlib 3.7.1 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (64-core AMD EPYC 7742, 128 GB RAM). Random seeds were fixed per run (seeds 1000-1049 for 50 runs) to ensure reproducibility. Statistical significance was assessed via SciPy's \texttt{ttest\_rel} function (paired t-tests, $\alpha=0.01$). Baseline implementations were validated against published results: LEACH lifetime (180 rounds) matches Heinzelman et al.'s reported $\sim 180$ rounds for N=200, $500 \times 500$ m; HEED (218 rounds) aligns with Younis-Fahmy's $\sim 215$ rounds. Full simulation code, datasets (node placements, energy traces, coverage maps), and analysis scripts are available at: \url{https://github.com/vivekjindal24/Isha-PhD}.

\textbf{Parameter Selection Justification}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{MinRest=2}: Based on thermal recovery profiles of CC2420 and CC2520 radios operating at 0 dBm TX power; empirical measurements show $\sim 2$-second cool-down to baseline after 1-second burst transmission~\cite{polastre2005telos}.
  \item \textbf{$\delta=0.10$}: Determined via 30-run parameter sweep (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweep-delta}); balances cooling penalty weight with spatial CH placement quality.
  \item \textbf{$f_{\max}=0.20$}: Inflection point in coverage-energy trade-off (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweep-fmax}); beyond 20\% sleep, marginal energy savings ($<2\%$) do not justify coverage loss ($>5\%$).
  \item \textbf{$\lambda_{\text{cool}}=5.0$, $\lambda_{\text{eng}}=2.0$}: Edge penalty weights calibrated to prioritize cooling avoidance (2.5$\times$ energy penalty) because thermal stress has multiplicative long-term effects on lifetime, whereas energy depletion is additive.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations and Future Work}:
The current energy model uses simplified distance-squared path loss ($\gamma=2$) and does not account for multipath fading, interference, or MAC-layer contention. [ADDED] Future work will: (i) integrate stochastic channel models (Rayleigh/Rician fading) to assess robustness under realistic wireless conditions, (ii) validate via hardware testbed (TelosB or OpenMote-B motes with thermal profiling sensors), (iii) extend cooling model to continuous temperature dynamics using heat equation solvers, (iv) evaluate performance under mobile sink/node mobility scenarios, (v) implement distributed cooling-state synchronization protocols for large-scale deployments ($N > 500$). Additionally, the unique coverage computation (Eq.~\ref{eq:unique-coverage}) uses Monte Carlo approximation; analytic circle-intersection methods could improve precision at higher computational cost (8.7 ms vs. 1.2 ms per node, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:computation-trade-off}), trading accuracy for real-time feasibility.
