\begin{abstract}
Heterogeneous smart farming wireless sensor networks (WSNs) must reconcile persistent environmental monitoring with stringent energy and latency constraints. We propose an integrated framework unifying (i) cooling-aware multi-criteria cluster head (CH) selection, (ii) routing that penalizes forwarding through nodes in enforced post-transmission cooling, and (iii) redundancy-driven sleep--wake coverage optimization with adaptive sensing-radius regulation. Evaluated over a 500 m $\times$ 500 m, 200-node (80\% normal, 20\% advanced) five-region deployment, the method achieves +80\% network lifetime, +31\% energy efficiency, +27.4\% coverage maintenance, +50.5\% cluster stability, and $-44.4$\% per-round energy usage versus LEACH, while sustaining 0.973 packet delivery ratio and $\approx 89.6$\% coverage. A $\sim 68$\% reduction in cooling overhead and 15.7\% incremental energy savings via redundancy-aware sleep--wake control demonstrate the value of elevating cooling state as a first-class optimization dimension.
