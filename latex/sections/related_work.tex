\subsection{Energy-Efficient Clustering in WSNs}
Hierarchical clustering protocols have been central to WSN energy optimization since the seminal work of Heinzelman et al.~\cite{heinzelman2000leach}. LEACH introduced randomized, probabilistic cluster head (CH) rotation, achieving distributed load balancing but with limited adaptivity to residual energy or spatial heterogeneity. Younis and Fahmy~\cite{younis2004heed} proposed HEED, which extends LEACH by incorporating residual energy and intra-cluster communication cost into CH selection, yielding more stable clusters. Smaragdakis et al.~\cite{smaragdakis2004sep} addressed heterogeneous networks via SEP, weighting CH election probabilities by initial energy tier, thus prolonging network lifetime through preferential selection of advanced nodes.

Despite these advances, none of the classical protocols explicitly model \emph{post-transmission cooling intervals}â€”the enforced temporal gap required after high-power transmissions to prevent thermal damage or regulatory violations. As a result, rapid successive CH re-elections or routing through recently active nodes can inadvertently degrade effective throughput and introduce hidden latency.

\subsection{Cooling and Thermal Constraints in Wireless Systems}
Thermal management in wireless devices has been explored primarily in cellular base stations~\cite{thermal_cellular2018} and high-density IoT deployments~\cite{iot_thermal2020}, where processor throttling and transmission scheduling are adjusted to maintain safe operating temperatures. However, explicit cooling-state modeling in WSN routing and clustering remains nascent. Recent work by Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang_cooling2021} introduced cooling-aware duty cycling for individual nodes but did not integrate cooling into multi-hop routing or CH selection cost functions. Our approach differs by treating cooling state as a \emph{first-class optimization variable} across all three subsystems: clustering, routing, and coverage control.

\subsection{Coverage Optimization and Redundancy Management}
Coverage maximization under energy constraints has been addressed through sleep scheduling~\cite{ye2003peas,tian2002node} and adaptive sensing radius control~\cite{wang2007coverage}. PEAS~\cite{ye2003peas} uses probing to keep only necessary sensors active, while Tian and Georganas~\cite{tian2002node} proposed node scheduling based on geometric coverage overlap. However, these methods do not consider the interplay between redundancy, energy expenditure, and cooling overhead. Our \emph{redundancy-driven sleep--wake optimization with adaptive radius contraction} uniquely couples spatial redundancy (unique coverage $U_i$) with energy and cooling state to co-optimize coverage preservation and thermal sustainability.

\subsection{Routing Under Operational Constraints}
Directed diffusion~\cite{intanagonwiwat2000directed} and gradient-based routing~\cite{schurgers2002energy} optimize paths based on energy reserves and link quality, but do not account for transient node unavailability due to cooling. Recent energy-aware routing protocols~\cite{mittal2017survey} focus on residual battery levels and hop counts; our cooling-aware Dijkstra variant extends this by imposing edge penalties for nodes with non-zero cooling remainder $C_i>0$, thereby avoiding latent forwarding bottlenecks.

\subsection{Positioning This Work}
\Cref{tab:related-comparison} summarizes key distinctions. Our integrated framework is the first to:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item Incorporate explicit cooling cost ($\delta \frac{C_i}{\text{MinRest}}$) into CH selection alongside distance, energy, and density.
  \item Penalize routing edges originating at cooling nodes via $\lambda_{cool}$ surcharges, ensuring paths avoid thermal bottlenecks.
  \item Unify redundancy-based sleep scheduling with adaptive sensing-radius contraction, preserving macro coverage while reducing per-node load and cooling frequency.
\end{enumerate}

This integrated cooling-aware paradigm yields substantial empirical gains (detailed in \Cref{sec:results}) while addressing a gap in the literature: the holistic incorporation of thermal state constraints into WSN optimization.
