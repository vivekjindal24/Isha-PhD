\section{Limitations}
Simplified radio (distance-squared path loss), absence of interference/fading, and deterministic sensing costs may understate real-world variability. Future work will integrate interference-aware link modeling, asynchronous duty cycles, predictive cooling/thermal dynamics, and hardware testbed validation.
