\section{Conclusion}
A unified cooling-aware clustered WSN architecture for smart farming was presented, combining penalized CH selection, cooling-sensitive routing, and redundancy-driven sleep--wake optimization with adaptive sensing control. Empirical gains in lifetime, energy efficiency, coverage constancy, and stability demonstrate the merit of elevating cooling state and redundancy as joint optimization dimensions. The framework is adaptable to other energy-critical environmental sensing domains.
