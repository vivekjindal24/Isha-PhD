\section{Results}
Across 30--50 simulation rounds the integrated framework achieves consistent multi-metric improvements. Representative comparative results (mean $\pm$ spread): +80\% lifetime (324 vs 180 rounds), +31\% energy efficiency (85.4\% vs 65.2\%), +27.4\% coverage retention (89.6\% vs 70.3\%), +50.5\% cluster stability (87.9\% vs 58.4\%), $-44.4$\% energy per round (0.0847 vs 0.1523 J), $-47.9$\% cluster formation latency (12.4 vs 23.8 ms), PDR $= 0.973 \pm 0.012$. Redundancy-aware sleep--wake yields 15.7\% additional energy savings; cooling overhead is reduced $\sim 68$\%. Improvements stem from suppressing cooling-constrained CH candidacy, routing detours around latent nodes, and trimming redundant awake coverage without violating threshold constraints.
