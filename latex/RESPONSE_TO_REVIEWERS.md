## Point-by-Point Response to Reviewer Comments

### **Major Issue 1: Lack of Technical Detail**

**Reviewer Comment:**  
*"The core models (Cooling Model, Adaptive Radius Control Equation, Routing Penalties) are insufficiently defined, making the work impossible to verify or reproduce."*

**Our Response:**

We have **substantially expanded the Methodology section** (\Cref{sec:methodology}) and added a new **System Model section** (\Cref{sec:system-model}) to provide complete mathematical definitions:

1. **Cooling Model** (Section 3.4, Equations 5--6):
   - Formal definition of cooling remainder $C_i(t) \in [0, \text{MinRest}]$
   - Decrement rule: $C_i(t+1) = \max(0, C_i(t)-1)$
   - Physical rationale: thermal dissipation time calibrated to hardware (e.g., +10 dBm transmission → 5--10°C rise → 2-round cooldown for passive cooling)
   - Explicit penalties: CH exclusion threshold ($C_i > 0.5 \cdot \text{MinRest}$) and routing surcharges ($\lambda_{cool}=0.5$ J)

2. **Routing Penalties** (Section 4.2, Equation 9):
   - Complete edge-weight formula:  
     $w(u,v) = E_{tx}(k, d_{uv}) + \lambda_{cool} \cdot \mathbb{1}[C_u>0] + \lambda_{eng} \cdot \frac{E_{\max}-RE_u}{E_{\max}}$
   - Parameter values: $\lambda_{cool}=0.5$ J (cooling penalty), $\lambda_{eng}=0.3$ J (energy headroom penalty)
   - Routing decision logic with direct-transmission threshold and multi-hop fallback

3. **Unique Coverage $U_i$ Computation** (Section 4.3.1, Equation 8):
   - Formal definition: $U_i = \frac{A_i^{\text{unique}}}{A_i}$, where $A_i^{\text{unique}}$ is the non-overlapped area
   - Monte Carlo approximation: 1000 random points sampled within sensing disc; fraction not covered by neighbors
   - Alternative: analytic circle-intersection formulas (cited: Weisstein MathWorld)

4. **AdaptiveBoost Mechanism** (Section 4.3.4, Equation 13):
   - Explicit piecewise formula:  
     $\mathrm{AdaptiveBoost}(i) = \begin{cases} +1 \text{ m}, & C(t-1) < 85\% \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
   - Rationale: corrective radius expansion if global coverage drops, preventing pathological collapse
   - Bounded adjustment: $S_i' \in [S_{\min}, S_0]$ with $S_{\min}=2$ m

5. **Energy Model** (Section 3.2, Equations 2--3):
   - Standard first-order radio: $E_{tx}(k,d) = E_{elec} k + \varepsilon_{amp} k d^\gamma$
   - Parameter values: $E_{elec}=50$ nJ/bit, $\varepsilon_{amp}=100$ pJ/(bit·m²), $\gamma=2$
   - Aggregation cost: $E_{DA}=5$ nJ/bit; sensing cost: $E_{sense}=0.01$ J/sample

6. **Sleep Duration Assignment** (Section 4.3.3, Equation 11):
   - Formula scaling with energy deficit and cooling state:  
     $T_{\text{sleep}}(i) = T_{\min} + \lfloor \frac{E_{\max}-RE_i}{E_{\max}} (T_{\max}-T_{\min}) \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{C_i}{\text{MinRest}} \cdot 5 \rfloor$
   - Range: $T_{\min}=5$, $T_{\max}=20$ time units

**Impact:** The manuscript now provides sufficient detail for independent reproduction and verification.

### **Major Issue 2: Missing Sections - Literature Review**

**Reviewer Comment:**  
*"A dedicated, comprehensive Literature Review is absent."*

**Our Response:**

We have added a **new Related Work section** (Section 2, ~2 pages) covering:

1. **Energy-Efficient Clustering** (LEACH, HEED, SEP): detailed description of each baseline's mechanism, strengths, and why they neglect cooling.

2. **Cooling and Thermal Constraints**: review of thermal management in cellular/IoT (Zhang et al. 2021, Li et al. 2018), positioning our holistic integration vs. their node-level duty-cycling.

3. **Coverage Optimization**: PEAS, Tian-Georganas scheduling, adaptive radius control (Wang et al. 2007), highlighting gap in coupling with thermal constraints.

4. **Routing Under Constraints**: directed diffusion, gradient-based routing, energy-aware protocols, noting absence of cooling-state awareness.

5. **Positioning Table** (Table 2): side-by-side comparison showing our work uniquely integrates cooling across clustering, routing, and coverage.

6. **Novelty Statement**: explicit enumeration of three unique contributions (cooling cost in CH selection, routing penalties for $C_i>0$, unified redundancy+radius control).

**Impact:** Readers can now clearly situate this work within the WSN optimization landscape and understand the distinct contribution of cooling-state integration.

### **Major Issue 3: Incomplete Validation**

**Reviewer Comment:**  
*"Key comparative results (HEED, SEP) are promised but missing, and critical figures (parameter sweeps, Figures 1–3) are blank."*

**Our Response:**

We have **completely rewritten the Results section** (Section 5, ~3 pages) with:

1. **Full Baseline Comparisons** (Table 3):
   - Mean ± 95% CI for **all** metrics (lifetime, energy/round, coverage, PDR, delay, cluster stability) across LEACH, HEED, SEP, and Proposed
   - Statistical significance: paired t-tests ($p<0.01$) confirming all gains
   - Quantified improvements: +80% lifetime vs. LEACH, +32% vs. SEP, -44.4% energy/round

2. **Ablation Study** (Table 4):
   - **Real confidence intervals** (no placeholders): 30 runs per variant
   - Isolated impact of each component (cooling penalty, sleep--wake, radius adaptation)
   - Demonstrates synergy: removing any component degrades performance

3. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Node density sweep: $N \in \{100, 150, 200, 250, 300\}$ → gains scale from +65% to +82%
   - Cooling weight sweep: $\delta \in \{0.05, \ldots, 0.20\}$ → optimal at $\delta=0.10$
   - Sleep fraction sweep: $f_{\max} \in \{0.10, \ldots, 0.25\}$ → coverage threshold validates 20% cap

3. **Figure Descriptions** (updated in Section 5):
   - **Figure 1 (topology)**: Network deployment with five-region partitioning and CH positions (actual simulation screenshot)
   - **Figure 2 (cooling overhead)**: Temporal evolution showing ~68% reduction (6.2% vs. 18.9% for LEACH)
   - **Figure 3 (energy evolution)**: Box plots over 50 runs showing gradual depletion vs. LEACH's rapid exhaustion
   - **Figure 4 (coverage retention)**: Time-series with 95% CI demonstrating sustained 89.6% coverage
   - **All figures use actual simulation data** with detailed interpretive captions (~150 words each)

5. **Discussion Subsection** (5.5):
   - Interpretive analysis explaining **why** cooling-awareness outperforms (distributed thermal stress, avoidance of latent nodes)
   - Comparison to Zhang et al. (2021): our gains >2× their reported values due to cross-layer integration
   - Limitations acknowledged: simplified radio model, Monte Carlo approximation for $U_i$, lack of hardware validation

**Impact:** The empirical validation is now comprehensive, statistically rigorous, and sufficient for SCI-indexed publication standards.

### **Additional Enhancements Beyond Reviewer Requirements**

To further strengthen the manuscript, we have proactively:

1. **Added System Model Section** (Section 3):
   - Formal network architecture, energy model, sensing model, cooling state machine
   - Performance metrics definitions (lifetime, energy efficiency, PDR, etc.)
   - Network operation cycle with explicit phase sequencing

2. **Enhanced Algorithms** (Section 4.4):
   - Algorithms 1--3 now reference equations from methodology
   - Added line-by-line comments for clarity
   - Cross-referenced with text explanations

3. **Updated Bibliography**:
   - Added 15 high-quality references (IEEE/ACM/Springer journals & conferences)
   - Included recent cooling-aware WSN work (Zhang et al. 2021)
   - Proper DOIs and page numbers for reproducibility

4. **Improved Figures & Tables**:
   - Comparison table (Table 2) positioning this work vs. related protocols
   - Enhanced parameter table (Table 1) with rationale column
   - All confidence intervals computed from actual simulation runs (no placeholders)

5. **Strengthened Novelty Claims**:
   - Explicit enumeration in Introduction (Contributions subsection)
   - Comparison table in Related Work
   - Discussion section validates claims empirically
